This chapter explores the core concepts and algorithms behind path planning and navigation in robotics.\\\\n\\\\n## Collision Avoidance\\\\n\\\\nOne of the primary concerns in robot motion is preventing collisions with obstacles in the environment or even with the robot\\\\\'s own body parts. Collision avoidance strategies can be proactive (planning collision-free paths) or reactive (adjusting motion in real-time).\\\\n\\\\n*   **Occupancy Grids:** A common way to represent the environment, where space is discretized into cells, each indicating the probability of being occupied by an obstacle. Sensors (like lidar or depth cameras) update these grids.\\\\n*   **Configuration Space (C-Space):** Transforms the robot\\\\\'s physical space into a higher-dimensional space where the robot is represented as a point, and obstacles grow correspondingly. Planning in C-space simplifies collision checking.\\\\n*   **Potential Fields:** An approach where the robot is attracted to the goal and repelled by obstacles. While intuitive, it can suffer from local minima.\\\\n\\\\n## Motion Planning Algorithms\\\\n\\\\nMotion planning algorithms generate a sequence of valid robot configurations (a path or trajectory) from a start to a goal state, avoiding collisions and respecting robot constraints.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Sampling-based Planners:** These algorithms explore the C-space by randomly sampling configurations and connecting them to build a graph or tree. They are often probabilistically complete (guaranteed to find a path if one exists, given enough time).\\\\n    *   **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT):** Builds a tree by incrementally extending random samples towards unexplored regions of the C-space. Popular for its efficiency in high-dimensional spaces.\\\\n    *   **Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM):** Constructs a roadmap (graph) by connecting randomly sampled valid configurations. Once the roadmap is built, pathfinding becomes a graph search problem (e.g., Dijkstra\\\\\'s or A\\\\*).\\\\n\\\\n*   **Search-based Planners:** These algorithms discretize the C-space into a grid and search for a path using graph search algorithms.\\\\n    *   **A\\\\* Search:** Finds the shortest path on a graph using a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal.\\\\n    *   **Dijkstra\\\\\'s Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, but without a heuristic, making it slower than A\\\\* for large graphs.\\\\n\\\\n## Navigation in Complex Environments\\\\n\\\\nNavigation involves the continuous process of localization (knowing where the robot is), mapping (creating a representation of the environment), and path planning.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** As discussed in Chapter 4, SLAM is critical for robots operating in unknown environments. It allows the robot to build a map while simultaneously figuring out its location within that map.\\\\n*   **Global Path Planning:** Generates an optimal or near-optimal path from the start to the goal using a complete map of the environment. This path is then followed by a local planner.\\\\n*   **Local Path Planning (Obstacle Avoidance):** Operates in real-time using local sensor data to react to unmapped obstacles or dynamic changes in the environment, making small adjustments to the global path.\\\\n\\\\n## Integration with ROS Navigation Stack\\\\n\\\\nROS provides a powerful and modular **Navigation Stack** that offers a complete solution for robot navigation, including global and local planning, costmap generation, and localization.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Components of ROS Navigation Stack:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **move_base:** The primary ROS node that ties together global planning, local planning, and recovery behaviors.\\\\n*   **amcl (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization):** A probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in a 2D occupancy grid map.\\\\n*   **gmapping:** A ROS package that provides a SLAM algorithm (based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters) to create 2D occupancy grid maps from laser scans.\\\\n*   **Costmaps:** 2D or 3D grids that represent the cost of traversing each cell, incorporating information about obstacles, inflation layers (to keep the robot away from obstacles), and unknown areas.\\\\n*   **Global Planners (e.g., global_planner, dijkstra_planner):** Compute a path from the start to goal using the entire costmap.\\\\n*   **Local Planners (e.g., dwa_local_planner, teb_local_planner):** Generate velocity commands to follow the global path and avoid local obstacles.\\\\n\\\\n**Example: ROS Navigation Stack Launch File Snippet (XML)**\\\\n\\\\nThis is a simplified move_base launch file. In a full system, you would have separate launch files for your robot model, sensor configurations, and specific planner parameters.\\\\n\\\\nxml\\\\n\x3c!-- move_base.launch --\x3e\\\\n<launch>\\\\n  <node pkg=\\\\\\"move_base\\\\\\" type=\\\\\\"move_base\\\\\\" respawn=\\\\\\"false\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\"move_base\\\\\\" output=\\\\\\"screen\\\\\\">\\\\n    <param name=\\\\\\"base_global_planner\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\"global_planner/GlobalPlanner\\\\\\" />\\\\n    <param name=\\\\\\"base_local_planner\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\"dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS\\\\\\" />\\\\n\\\\n    \x3c!-- Load costmap parameters --\x3e\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/costmap_common_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" ns=\\\\\\"global_costmap\\\\\\" />\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/costmap_common_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" ns=\\\\\\"local_costmap\\\\\\" />\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/global_costmap_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" />\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/local_costmap_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" />\\\\n\\\\n    \x3c!-- Load planner parameters --\x3e\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/base_local_planner_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" />\\\\n    <rosparam file=\\\\\\"$(find my_robot_nav)/config/global_planner_params.yaml\\\\\\" command=\\\\\\"load\\\\\\" />\\\\n  </node>\\\\n</launch>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis example shows how move_base integrates different planners and costmaps. The my_robot_nav/config directory would contain .yaml files defining the specific parameters for the costmaps and planners.\\\\n\\\\nPath planning and navigation are essential for enabling humanoid robots to achieve complex goals autonomously and safely in real-world environments.\\\\n","permalink":"/humanoid-robot-book/path-planning/"},"next":{"title":"08 - AI and Machine Learning for Humanoids","permalink":"/humanoid-robot-book/ai-learning/"}}');var o=a(4848),t=a(8453);const s={},r="07 - Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)",l={},c=[{value:"Speech Recognition and Synthesis",id:"speech-recognition-and-synthesis",level:2},{value:"Gesture Recognition",id:"gesture-recognition",level:2},{value:"Safe and Intuitive Interaction Design",id:"safe-and-intuitive-interaction-design",level:2},{value:"Ethical Guidelines in HRI",id:"ethical-guidelines-in-hri",level:2}];function d(n){const e={em:"em",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",header:"header",li:"li",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...(0,t.R)(),...n.components};return(0,o.jsxs)(o.Fragment,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(e.header,{children:(0,o.jsx)(e.h1,{id:"07---human-robot-interaction-hri",children:"07 - Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:"Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the design, implementation, and evaluation of robots and robotic systems that interact with humans.
