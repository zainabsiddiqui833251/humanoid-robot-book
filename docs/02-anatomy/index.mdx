# 02 - Humanoid Robot Anatomy

The anatomy of a humanoid robot is a complex interplay of mechanical structures, powerful actuators, sophisticated sensors, and efficient power systems. Each component is meticulously designed to mimic, or even surpass, the capabilities of the human body.

## Mechanical Structure: Links and Joints

Like the human skeleton, humanoid robots are built with a series of rigid **links** connected by **joints**. The links represent the segments of the robot (e.g., upper arm, forearm, thigh, shin), while the joints allow for relative motion between these links.

*   **Links:** Typically made from lightweight yet strong materials like aluminum alloys, carbon fiber, or plastics (for rapid prototyping). Their design impacts the robot's weight, inertia, and overall dynamic performance.
*   **Joints:** These are the articulation points that enable movement. Common types include:
    *   **Revolute Joints (Rotational):** Allow rotation around a single axis, similar to a knee or elbow joint. Most robot joints are revolute.
    *   **Prismatic Joints (Translational):** Allow linear movement along a single axis, less common in humanoids but found in some specialized applications.

The number of joints and their arrangement define the robot's **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**. A typical humanoid robot might have 20-40 DoF, distributed across its neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, allowing for a wide range of movements necessary for human-like tasks.

## Actuators: The Muscles of a Humanoid

Actuators are the components responsible for generating motion at the joints, analogous to biological muscles. They convert electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic energy into mechanical force or torque.

*   **Electric Motors:** The most common type due to their precision, ease of control, and clean operation.
    *   **DC Motors:** Simple, robust, but can be less efficient for continuous high torque.
    *   **Brushless DC (BLDC) Motors:** Highly efficient, offer good power-to-weight ratio, and are very common in advanced humanoids.
    *   **Servo Motors:** Integrated with a gearbox and a feedback sensor (encoder) for precise position control. High-quality servos are essential for humanoid joints.
*   **Hydraulic Actuators:** Offer very high power density and stiffness, ideal for dynamic and powerful robots (e.g., Boston Dynamics' Atlas). They use incompressible fluid under pressure.
*   **Pneumatic Actuators:** Use compressed air. Lighter and faster than hydraulics but typically less precise and powerful, often used for grippers or simpler movements.

**Gearboxes** (e.g., harmonic drives, cycloidal drives) are almost always coupled with motors to increase torque and reduce speed, as direct-drive motors rarely have enough torque for humanoid applications.

## Sensors: Perceiving the World

Sensors provide the robot with information about its internal state and external environment, crucial for perception, control, and interaction.

*   **Proprioceptive Sensors (Internal State):**
    *   **Encoders:** Measure joint angles or rotational positions (e.g., optical, magnetic encoders).
    *   **Potentiometers:** Measure linear or angular displacement.
    *   **Force/Torque Sensors:** Located at wrists, ankles, or feet to measure contact forces and torques, essential for balance and manipulation.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs):** Contain accelerometers and gyroscopes (sometimes magnetometers) to measure orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. Critical for balance and whole-body control.
*   **Exteroceptive Sensors (External Environment):**
    *   **Cameras:** Provide visual information for object recognition, navigation, human detection, and facial recognition (e.g., monocular, stereo, depth cameras like Intel RealSense or Microsoft Kinect).
    *   **Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging):** Uses pulsed laser to measure distances to create 2D or 3D maps of the environment.
    *   **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Measure distances using sound waves, useful for short-range obstacle detection.
    *   **Tactile Sensors:** Arrays of pressure sensors on fingertips or body surfaces to detect contact, pressure distribution, and texture, enhancing manipulation and interaction safety.

## Power Systems: The Energy Source

Humanoid robots require significant power to operate their many actuators and sensors. The power system is a critical design consideration, balancing energy density, weight, and runtime.

*   **Batteries:** Lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries are commonly used due to their high energy density and relatively low weight. Battery management systems (BMS) are essential for safety and optimal performance.
*   **Power Distribution:** Complex circuitry is needed to distribute power efficiently and safely to all components (motors, sensors, computing units), often involving DC-DC converters and voltage regulators.
*   **Wired Power (Tethered):** For research platforms or stationary humanoids, tethered power can provide unlimited runtime and higher power delivery, avoiding battery weight limitations.

Understanding the intricate design and function of each anatomical component is fundamental to grasping how humanoid robots move, perceive, and interact with the world.
