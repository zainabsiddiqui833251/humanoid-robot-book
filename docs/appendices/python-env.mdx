# Python Environment Setup

This appendix guides you through setting up a robust Python development environment, which is essential for working with the code examples and tools used throughout this book on humanoid robotics.

## 1. Installing Python

Many Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. However, it's often a system Python, and it's generally best to install a specific version for development to avoid conflicts.

### On Ubuntu/Debian:

1.  **Update package list:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

2.  **Install Python 3.9 (or a preferred version):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3-pip
    ```
    Replace `python3.9` with your desired version if different. `python3.9-venv` is crucial for creating virtual environments.

3.  **Verify installation:**
    ```bash
    python3.9 --version
    pip3 --version
    ```

## 2. Managing Python Environments with `venv`

Virtual environments are critical for isolating project dependencies. This prevents conflicts between different projects that might require different versions of the same library.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `~/humanoid_robot_code`) and create a virtual environment named `.venv`:
    ```bash
    cd ~/humanoid_robot_code
    python3.9 -m venv .venv
    ```
    You can choose any name instead of `.venv`, but `.`-prefixed directories are often hidden and a common convention.

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    You'll see `(.venv)` or your chosen environment name appear in your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
    When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the environment:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## 3. Installing Python Packages with `pip`

Once your virtual environment is active, you can install project-specific Python packages using `pip`.

1.  **Install common robotics/ML packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyterlab
    ```
    *   `numpy`: Fundamental package for numerical computing.
    *   `scipy`: Library for scientific and technical computing.
    *   `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
    *   `ipython`: Enhanced interactive Python shell.
    *   `jupyterlab`: Web-based interactive development environment (notebooks).

2.  **Install deep learning frameworks (if needed):**
    *   **TensorFlow:**
        ```bash
        pip install tensorflow
        ```
    *   **PyTorch:**
        ```bash
        pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
        # For GPU versions, refer to PyTorch official installation guide.
        ```

3.  **Generate a `requirements.txt` file:**
    It's good practice to list all project dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file so others (or your future self) can easily set up the environment.
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install packages from `requirements.txt`:**
    To set up a new environment with the same dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

By following these steps, you will have a well-organized and reproducible Python development environment for your humanoid robotics projects.
